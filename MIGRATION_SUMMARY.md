## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### From Reactstrap (Bootstrap) to Material-UI

| Component | Salon Admin (Reactstrap) | Tokyo Dashboard (MUI) |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Container | Container | Container |
| Row/Col | Row, Col | Grid container/item |
| Button | Button | Button |
| Card | Card, CardBody, CardHeader | Card, CardContent, CardHeader |
| Form | Form, Input, Label | TextField, Box |
| Table | Table (basic) | DataGrid (advanced) |
| Modal | Modal | Dialog |
| Alert | Alert | Alert |
| Badge | Badge | Chip |
| Navbar | Navbar | AppBar |

### Benefits of MUI:
- ✅ Better TypeScript support
- ✅ More component customization
- ✅ Built-in theming system

3. **Profile & Settings** - User experience
4. **Board/Kanban** - Task management
5. **Static Pages** - Legal compliance
6. **Blog Management** - Content marketing
7. **Additional Analytics** - Business insights

### Enhancements:
